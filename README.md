# Outsourcing children's social care

Welcome to a repository of reproducibility files for the upcoming paper in Social Science and Medicine, led by [Anders Bach-Mortensen](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/anders-bach-mortensen) and co-authored by myself and [Jane Barlow](https://www.spi.ox.ac.uk/people/professor-jane-barlow), titled 'Outsourcing and performance of childrenâ€™s social care services: a longitudinal analysis of English providers and local authorities.'

The entire paper is written in RMarkdown. In theory anyone should be able to download the .Rmd file in the manuscript folder and reproduce all the analyses, text and citations in the paper without any additional files simply by knitting the file. (To download the Rmd file, click 'raw' on the 'CSC_Outsourcing_Manuscript.Rmd' file, right click on the page, 'save as', change the name of the file making sure it still ends '.Rmd', and save it as 'all files' - not a text document).

Some of the models used in the paper take a long time to run and so, if knitting the entire paper, be warned it may take your laptop around 30 minutes.

The data used in the analysis is published in the data folder of this repository, raw data locations are provided in the 'data locations' file also in the data folder. Code used to clean the data is published in the 'Raw Code' folder - it is very messy but available for full transparency.

Data on violated legal requirements and recommendations were received privately and have not been published with an Open Government License. Consequently I have not published this data - I would be very happy to share upon request with the approval of the data manager. I have included the code used to analyse the requirements and recommendations regardless.

Any questions on the paper, code or reproducibility can be directed to me at benjamin.goodair@spi.ox.ac.uk or to the lead author Dr Anders Bach-Mortensen at anders.bach-mortensen@spi.ox.ac.uk.
