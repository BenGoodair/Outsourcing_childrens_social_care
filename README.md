# Outsourcing children's social care

Welcome to a repository of reproducibility files for the upcoming paper in Social Science and Medicine, co-authored with Anders Bach-Mortensen, titled 'Outsourcing and performance of childrenâ€™s social care services: a longitudinal analysis of English providers and local authorities.'

The entire paper is written in RMarkdown. In theory anyone should be able to download the .Rmd file in the manuscript folder and reproduce all the analyses, text and citations in the paper without any additional files simply by knitting the file. (To download the Rmd file, click 'raw' on the 'CSC_Outsourcing_Manuscript.Rmd' file, right click on the page, 'save as', change the name of the file making sure it still ends '.Rmd', and save it as 'all files' - not a text document).

The data used in the analysis is published in the data folder of this repository, raw data locations are provided in the 'data locations' file also in the data folder.
